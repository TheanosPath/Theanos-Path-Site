  <h1>Few arrive. Fewer understand.</h1>
  <h2>Welcome to Theano's Path</h2>

  <div class="blurb">
    <p>Not everyone should continue. Most won’t make it far.<br>
    Most probably didn't even make it this far. <br>
    This is not a game. This is a test — of perception, of logic, of patience.<br>
    It will demand more than guesswork. It will outlast your attention span.<br>
    There are no hints. No shortcuts. No mercy.<br>
    Just a path — ancient, tangled, and hidden in plain sight.<br><br>
    The reward? $1,000 — perhaps more.<br>
    But only for the one who finishes first.<br><br>
    If that sounds like you, enter your name and email.<br>
    And remember: from here on, everything is a clue.</p>
